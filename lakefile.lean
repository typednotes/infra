  Build configuration.

  This was `lakefile.toml` until `infra` started using Linen's FFI-backed
  features (`System.Keychain` for credentials, and OpenSSL-backed TLS/SigV4 for
  the provider clients). Lake does **not** propagate a dependency's
  `moreLinkArgs` to a dependent's executable: `liblinenffi.a` is on the link
  line, but the flags its members need are not, so `keychain.o` fails to link
  with undefined `SecItemCopyMatching`/`CFRelease`. TOML has no way to express
  the platform-conditional flags that fixes, hence Lean.

  Only the flags for the FFI `infra` actually reaches are declared. A static
  archive contributes only the members whose symbols are referenced, so there
  is no need for Linen's libpq or DuckDB flags here.

  Resolution happens at lakefile-elaboration time on the build machine, so
  nothing is hardcoded to one developer's paths.

/-- Ask `pkg-config` for a package's flags, degrading to `#[]` when it or the
    package is missing — matching how Linen treats optional native
    dependencies. -/
def pkgConfigFlags (args : Array String) : IO (Array String) := do
  try
    let out ← IO.Process.output { cmd := "pkg-config", args }
    if out.exitCode != 0 then return #[]
    return (out.stdout.trimAscii.copy.splitOn " ").toArray.map (·.trimAscii.copy)
      |>.filter (· != "")
  catch _ => return #[]

/-- Link flags naming each library file outright, rather than adding its
    directory to the search path.

    On Linux, `pkg-config --variable=libdir` is typically
    `/usr/lib/x86_64-linux-gnu`, which holds the *system* `libc.so` alongside
    everything else. Passing that as `-L` makes `ld.lld` prefer the system
    glibc over the one Lean bundles, and Lean's own `Scrt1.o` references
    `__libc_csu_init` — removed in glibc 2.34. The result is a link that fails
    with an undefined symbol in the C runtime, nowhere near anything this
    package wrote.

    Linen has the same `-L` and never hits this, because only `lean_lib Linen`
    is a default target there: `lake build` never links an executable. `infra`
    does.

    Naming `<libdir>/libfoo.so` directly links exactly the intended file and
    shadows nothing. Falls back to `-lfoo` if the file is absent, so a distro
    with a different layout still gets a chance. -/

  -- $OPENSSL/lib/libcrypto.a stage1/lib/`). Those archives are already the
  -- last thing on the line, which is exactly where an archive has to sit to
  -- satisfy `liblinenffi.a` above it.
  --
  -- Naming the system OpenSSL as well is not merely redundant on Linux, it is
  -- fatal. A current distro's `libssl.so`/`libcrypto.so` need
  -- `stat@GLIBC_2.33`, `dlopen@GLIBC_2.34` and `__isoc23_strtol@GLIBC_2.38`,
  -- while the glibc Lean bundles under `lib/glibc` predates all three — it
  -- still has the `__libc_csu_init` that glibc 2.34 removed. Under lld's
  -- default `--no-allow-shlib-undefined` that is an immediate link failure on
  -- eighteen symbols no code here can reach.
  --
  -- Dropping it retires the macOS hazard too: the reason to point at
  -- Homebrew's OpenSSL was that dyld could otherwise bind to the system's
  -- incompatible `libboringssl` and crash on the first TLS call. A static
  -- archive cannot be re-bound at runtime, so the failure mode is gone rather
  -- than merely avoided.
  --
  -- The Linux CI still installs `libssl-dev`, for the *headers* Linen's
  -- `jose.c`/`tls.c` compile against. Only the link flags are unnecessary.
